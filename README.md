TO DO: set up binder link 

Project description

## Directory Structure

This repo contains a few subfolders which contain the elements of this project.

| Folder | Description |
|-----|-----|
| `data`  | data from the original analysis in CSV, TSV, and pip-separated format  |
| `notebooks`  | Jupyter Notebook files  |

## Final Project Details

Your repo should contain _all_ of the folders listed above, and they should contain the appropriate files (e.g. the notebook with your analysis goes into the `notebooks` folder).

### Pre-Analysis Plan

This should be completed after you have your data set but before you begin your analysis. **Make sure to timestamp this document!** This is the whole point of a Pre-Analysis Plan. It should contain the following sections:

| Section | Description |
|-----|-----|
| Abstract  | an abstract for your project, excl. findings  |
| Data  | description of your data set (something akin to a synthesis of the Step 1 assignment)  |
| Strategy  | an outline of the steps you will take to analyze your data (mostly a description of the code)  |
| Analysis  | any heuristics or mathematical models that you use, and the reasons for their use  |
| Deliverables  | a description of the deliverable files in the repo, incl. where your presentation is  |
| Sources   | list of sources for your data _and any other research_ that you did  |

### MyBinder

You should note that this repository has a MyBinder link (at the top of this README) which links to MyBinder to allow others to run our code. _Your repository should also include such a link._ The steps to create this link are given below:

1. Copy the `requirements.txt` file from this repo and add it to yours. This should cover all dependencies, but if you use any that are not listed in that file, _make sure to add them_.
2. Go to the [MyBinder website](https://mybinder.org/) and paste the URL to your repo in the `GitHub repository name or URL` field (pictured below).
3. Include the brach name in the `Git branch, tag, or commit` field; for most, this will be `master`.
4. Open the dropdown below the Binder URL and copy the text next to the ![Markdown logo](images/markdown.png).
5. Paste this text into your README right below where your names are listed at the top. For our repo, it looked like this:

```markdown
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ls88-openscienceconnector/final-project/master)
```

Here is a screenshot of the website filled out for this repo:

### Github Best Practices

Note that this repository has a README and that each subfolder (except for the `images` folder) has a README as well. This should be reflected in the repo that you submit.

Make sure that your files render properly in Github. For example, Github does not render the LaTeX `\limits` command, and any display math that uses it will not be rendered.

**License:** Your repository should have a license on it. For most, if not all, of you, this will be a CC0 license, however we leave it at your discretion to choose the license for your project. Because Github no longer lists the CC0 template in its template chooser, we provide a link below to load this template into your repository. To use it, simply replace `<repo>` with the name of your repository.

> `https://github.com/ls88-openscienceconnector/<repo>/community/license/new?branch=master&template=cc0-1.0`

### Deliverables

Your project should have some deliverable (e.g. PDF, PPT, data). These should be uploaded in the `output` folder of your repo. If it is not a file you can upload (e.g. a Google Slides presentation), it should be linked-to in the README for that folder (even if this means you have a folder that is empty except for a README).
